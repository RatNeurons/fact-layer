## Synopsis

Fact Layer is a contextual fact checker extention for web browsers. It provides relevent information on the site and article you're reading, such as biases of the site, whether it's satire, and if there's fact checking articles debunking the article. All the sources to these determinations are included, which provided a high level of transparancy. The tagging of fact checking pages to news articles is community driven, so my hope is in time it will become a more complete resource. 

## Motivation

This project was born out of my annoyance with having to constantly google articles to see if what I was reading was legitamite. I've tried other plugins in the past, like WoT, but I feel they're too open-ended for fact checking. By limiting the fact tagging to known sites and fact checking services, I hope to prevent false tagging of content simeply because the user doesn't agree with it. Nothing is a substitute for doing your own research, but not everyone has time to look into every article they come accross. That's where this plugin comes into play!
